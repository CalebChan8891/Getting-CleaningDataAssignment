# Code Book
This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in tidy.txt and contains a description of the work performed to clean the data with the R script 'run_analysis.R'.

## Identifiers
ActivityNum - The number of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken Measurements. Please refer to Activity Labels below for more details.

Activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken. Please refer to Activity Labels below for more details.


Subject - The ID of the test subject. There are 30 subjects i.e. ID is 1:30.


## Variables. Note: For variable, the values were normalized and therefore these values are between -1 and 1.
